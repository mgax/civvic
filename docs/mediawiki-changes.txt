When I installed MediaWiki, I made these changes inside the
installation directory:

- After the web-based configuration, I moved LocalSettings.php into
  the parent directory.
- Added this to the bottom of LocalSettings.php in order to enable short URLs:

  $wgArticlePath = "/wiki/$1";  # Virtual path. This directory MUST be different from the one used in $wgScriptPath
  $wgUsePathInfo = true;        # Enable use of pretty URLs
