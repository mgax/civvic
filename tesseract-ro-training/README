boxingCoach: rudimentary web-based box editor

tessdata-001: Data from an attempt I made to print my own fonts, scan
  the pages, and train tesseract on that. It wasn't very useful because
  the fonts were different from the MO fonts

tessdata-002: Data from an attempt I made to train tesseract on several
  pages from the MO archive (up to 1994).

tessdata-003: Romanian data downloaded from the Tesseract website. This
  gives by far the best results so far.

tessdata-004: Copied from 003, then replaced the word and freq dawgs with
  the word lists extracted from the MO corpus.
